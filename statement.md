The color of the circles are determined the percentage points more white the police department is over the city population.
0-9 percentage points more white: #edf8e9
10-19 percentage points more white: #bae4b3
20-29 percentage points more white: #74c476
30-39 percentage points more white: #31a354
40-52 percentage points more white: #006d2c


In addition, please send me a brief statement explaining methodology, reporting issues, etc., to include in the post. Overall, is the Bay Area doing better/worse in this measurement than the rest of the country? 

Hayward PD data from http://www.ci.hayward.ca.us/NEWS/2014/CALEA_Final_Report.pdf

All other police department data comes from 2007 Bureau of Justice Statistics

All city population data is from 2010 U.S. Census Bureau

Edits: 
-  Info box looks good, but the rollover percentage should indicate race designation
- margin for “Police officers” - make sure it’s not cut off
- opacity, ensure that popup can still close
