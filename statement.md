In addition, please send me a brief statement explaining methodology, reporting issues, etc., to include in the post. Overall, is the Bay Area doing better/worse in this measurement than the rest of the country? 

Hayward PD data from http://www.ci.hayward.ca.us/NEWS/2014/CALEA_Final_Report.pdf
2013 CALEA Assessment Report 
	- white, black, hispanic, and other

All other PD data from 2007 Bureau of Justice Statistics
* * I have designated as “other” 
- American Indian or Alaskan
- Native Hawaiian or Pacific Island
- Two or More Races
- No information

All city population data is from 2010 U.S. Census Bureau
* I have designated as “other” 
	- American Indian or Alaskan
- Native Hawaiian or Pacific Island
- Two or More Races
- Other

****Percentage of the police department that is white minus the percentage of the city population that is white** 


Edits: 
-  Info box looks good, but the rollover percentage should indicate race designation (even though it’s in the color legend) – so: “50% white”
